# CheapTrip - Sample Android App

This project was created to help people understand the latest best practices about Android app development.

I know there are a lot of things to learn and most of the time is really overwhelming but I 
will try my best to help you as much as I can.

## Project X-Ray

Throughout this project's development I will be updating the wiki with tons of specific information about this project.

In the future I plan to have one page explaining the implementation of each component in my app.

For example, it will have a page for Dagger2 where I will be covering the basics and how I implemented it in this app.

Also, it will contain a lot of good external resources where you can learn more about that subject and consolidate your knowledge from a different perspective.

## How to Build

For this project I wanted to create something related to travel. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any free and fast to
implement travel API (maybe I didn't search enough) to use in this project. For this reason I decided to create my own API
fed by dummy data to mock API calls.

In order to build this project you will need to [download the Django project](https://github.com/rickpms/CheapTripDjango) and run it. Step by step [here](#runninglocalserver).

If you already downloaded this project and ran the Django local server you need to set up the base url correctly to start fetching data
from API. The retrofit service is being created inside AppModule.kt and the base url parameter on "Retrofit.Builder()" is what you
need to change. This base url should be your local network IP.

On MAC you can find on: System Preferences > Network

**DO NOT** build this project on android API 28 (Android Pie). Due to security reasons it won't let you fetch information from your
local server that will be under "http" protocol. If you still want to do this way there are couple workaround that a simple google search
will do the job.

*App created on Android Studio 3.2 beta 5*

## <a name="runninglocalserver">Running Django Local Server</a>

If you already know how to setup a Django project you need to run the server like this:

`python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

It will pretty much allow any hardware (android emulator, physical devices) to access your local server without further problems.
